Dick Weisinger over at [FormTek](http://www.formtek.com/) posted a great article on adding new workflows to the Share 3.4 using the newly updated form service.  I'm currently developing similar functionality for 3.4b and found the same results - jbmp workflows just seems to work in the share interface.
