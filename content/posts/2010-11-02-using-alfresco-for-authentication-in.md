Kevin Roast’s blog had a great post about [Authentication User’s against an Alfresco Repository](http://blogs.alfresco.com/wp/kevinr/2010/11/01/springsurf-authenticating-users-against-an-alfresco-repository/).  When we first explored Surf, when it starting to get traction in 3.2 or 3.3 our major complaint was that it seemed difficult to actually connect to the repository.

I’m glad to see that this has changed.

Or that it is now better documented.
