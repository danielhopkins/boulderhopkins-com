Nate McMinn has a [brief wrap up](http://www.unorganizedmachines.com/site/software-and-technology/42-events/110-alfresco-devcon-nyc-wrap-up) of the Alfresco developers convention.  I was unable to attend and it sounds like I missed a lot of interesting news.  I was excited to here:

> One upcoming project that was discussed at DevCon is putting together a third-party components catalog for Alfresco.  Right now there is nothing like this available.  Alfresco community projects are scattered all over the place.  Some are in Alfresco Forge, some are on Google Code, still others are on developers' blogs (mine included).  I'm sure I'm forgetting a few locations, but you get the idea.  Rolling all of this up in one queryable repository would be a fantastic addition to the Alfresco community.

I wonder how this will be deployed and who will maintain it.  The wiki idea for documentation seems to be barely moving along.
